title: Summarize Server Log Errors
instruction: |
  A web server is producing logs at `/app/data/server.log`.
  Your task is to write a shell script to parse this file and generate a summary of all ERROR events.

  **Requirements:**

  1.  Process the log file located at `/app/data/server.log`.
  2.  Identify all lines that contain the string "ERROR".
  3.  For each error line, extract the source IP address (it's the last word on the line).
  4.  Count the number of errors that occurred for each unique IP address.
  5.  Create a CSV file at `/app/reports/error_summary.csv`.
  6.  The CSV file must contain two columns with a header: `ip_address,error_count`.
  7.  The data rows in the CSV file must be sorted in descending numerical order based on the `error_count`.
